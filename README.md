# Framer Experiments

[FramerJS](http://framerjs.com/) is a rapid prototyping tool developed by [Koen bok](https://twitter.com/koenbok) and the team at Podium. The following is a selection of experiments that I created in order to learn Framer and can hopefully serve as a resource of projects to help others in their Framer explorations.
